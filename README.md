## Introduction
This project aims to conduct a dynamic analysis of a twin-spool turbojet engine. It includes constructing a finite element model using the open-source software ROS, generating the Campbell diagram from 0 to 2000 RPM, determining the critical speeds of the engine, defining the modes at 0 RPM, and finally assessing whether a speed of 5000 RPM is achievable for the system.



## Requirements
This project requires the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install these dependencies, ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed, then run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
The code is inspired by the ROS software. The function changes are documented in `complete_ross.py`. The main usage is to run `main_jupyter.ipynb`, which will guide you through all the necessary results step by step.
