## Introduction
This project aim to do a dynamic annalyse of a twin-spool turbo-jet engine, with the construction of a finite elment using the open source rose, create the campbelle diagrame at 0 to 2000 RPM, determined the critical speed of the engine, define s modes at 0 RMP and finally look if the speed of 5000 RPM is possible for the system.

Project is a bit messy i do the first part of it, and this is show with the jupyter

## Reqirements
This project requires the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install these dependencies, ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed, then run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
The code is inspired by the software ross, the function is change in the doc `complete_ross.py`, the main usage, is for run the `main_jupyter.ipynb`, which going to show you all the result you need step by step.
